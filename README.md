## AdventureWorks

#### Description
WCF database service tailored for my shop projects, working on the standard AdventureWorks database.

#### News
This data service  is no longer functional on Azure.

#### Purpose
* Explore various techniques based on C#, EF and WCF.
* Manage the code by Git and GitHub.
* Explore continuous integration by using buildmanager TeamCity.
* Explore Scrum process management by integration with Jira or Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS).

#### Prerequisites
* The service assumes the presence of an AdventureWorks2014 database, to which a connection should be configured.
* Note that currently a self signed certifcate on the server is enough to let the https binding function and be accepted by an Android device.
* For the contents of this database I refer to http://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/releases/view/125550

#### Notes
