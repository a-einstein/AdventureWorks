#### Purpose
* Supplying WCF database services tailored to my shop projects, working on the standard AdventureWorks database.

#### Aspects
* C#.
* SQL Server.
* Use a Azure Database.
* Be deployed as an Azure service.
* Entity Framework.
* WCF + SSL.
* Asynchronisity.


#### Prerequisites
* The service assumes the presence of an AdventureWorks2014 database, to which a connection should be configured.
* Note that currently a self signed certifcate on the server is enough to let the https binding function and be accepted by an Android device.
* For the contents of this database I refer to http://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/releases/view/125550
