## AdventureWorksServices

#### Purpose
* Supplying a database service tailored to my WPF project.

#### Aspects
* Makes use of Entity Framework.

#### Notes
* This is still a pretty rough cut early version.

#### Prerequisites
* The service assumes the presence of an AdventureWorks2014 database, to which a connection should be configured.
* For the contents of this database I refer to http://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/releases/view/125550
